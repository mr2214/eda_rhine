snow cover over mountainous regions,
rates of evapotranspiration

assumptions around modelling of temperature,
similar patterns around human use of water resources
weather patterns will not change, like the thermohaline cycle, beyond climate model

how humans should repspond to issues around changing levels of water in river rhine, analyse what issuse could arise such as flooding, water shortages and economic inpact on humans, hence with info better placed to make informed descisions.
